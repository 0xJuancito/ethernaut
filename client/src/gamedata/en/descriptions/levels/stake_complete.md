When using code that you don't own, it's a good idea to familiarize yourself with it to get a good understanding of how it all fits together. This can be particularly important when there are multiple levels of imports (your imports have imports) or when you are implementing authorization controls, for example when you are allowing or not allowing people to do things. In this example, a developer might look at the code and think that `transfer` is the only way to move tokens, but there are other ways to perform the same operation with a different implementation.
